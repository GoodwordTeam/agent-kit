# Carried forward — obligations that must reach a later batch

Written because the obligations below existed only in messages and in the team lead's context,
which is the same defect found in §12.2 on 2026-09-19: a durable obligation recorded in a handback
leaves no trace in the tracked tree, so a resolved obligation and a forgotten one are
indistinguishable to anyone reading the repo. `.omc/` is gitignored and no handback has ever been
committed. This file is tracked; that is the whole point of it.

**How to use it.** Each entry names the batch that must carry it and the reason it cannot be
re-derived from the contract. When a brief is written for one of these batches, the entry is copied
into that brief and **deleted here in the same commit**. An entry left standing after its batch has
landed is a defect, not a record — the same retirement discipline `d664d00` applied to §10's
disclosure paragraphs.

## Batch 3 — in flight

Nothing carried. `research/briefs/batch-03-define.md` is complete and the writer is running against
it.

## Batch 5 — review-ship

**§6.2 is an input to this brief, not background.** Two rows of
`provenance/conversation-map.yaml` settle here rather than earlier, and the brief must say so
explicitly or the writer will treat them as already dispositioned. Confirmed with `provmap`.

**The implementer-approval-context sentence is flagged "ruled elsewhere."** The brief must carry the
flag so the writer does not re-derive the ruling or, worse, restate it in narrower terms — the
failure mode that produced F-1 and F-2 in batch 2.

**The batch-5 checkpoint gates on arch §10 scenarios 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 18, 20.** Scenarios **7
and 20 have no ruling** in `policies/resolved-conflicts.yaml`. That is a gap to close before the
checkpoint runs, not at it: a checkpoint gating on a scenario with no ruling has nothing to check the
behaviour against.

**`super-ship` is dry-run only at the checkpoint.** The PR payload is generated locally and nothing
is pushed. This is a constraint from the implementation plan, not a suggestion.

**Three verification rules belong in this brief, and they are one family.** Each was found by an
agent being wrong about their own instrument, which is why they are worth stating rather than
assuming:

- **The population check.** Name the population the check owns, then verify every member reaches a
  term in the output. Replaces the counterfactual form, which requires naming the hypothesis — and
  the hypothesis that catches you is the one you did not think of. In `AUTHORING.md` §8 as of
  `9e8ca8e`. Predicts where to look: any check whose output is a tally rather than a list.
- **Reporting on the tree versus reporting on itself.** A gap in the tree is a fact the probe
  reports, and whether to gate on it is a per-probe call. A source the probe can no longer read is a
  fact about the probe, and every number underneath it is worthless — that exits non-zero
  unconditionally, in any probe, whatever its reporting half does.
- **The clause narrower than its rule.** Three separate findings in batch 2 were one defect: a
  clause whose population is narrower than the rule it cites, surviving because the narrower clause
  is the one a reader supplies unprompted. The instruction that generalises is not "check the
  citations" but "name the population the cited rule owns, then check the citing sentence reaches
  every member."

**A clean validate is evidence about the instruments, not about the tree.** The 29-body row-2 sweep
changed no `ak validate` output at all — 0 errors, 4 warnings, 49 notes before and after — because
nothing enforced §12.2's mandated rows. A handback saying a check came back clean owes a second
sentence saying what that check could not have seen. §8 requires this as of `9e8ca8e`.

## Batch 6 — packs and references

**Three retroactive edits land with this batch**, each touching a body authored in an earlier,
now-closed batch:

| Body | Authored in |
|---|---|
| `super-build` | batch 4 |
| `super-review` | batch 5 |
| `doc-review` | batch 3 |

These are cross-batch edits, which §12.2's backward-reach paragraph normally routes to the earlier
batch's fix cycle. Batches 3, 4 and 5 will be closed and out of cycles by then, so the routing the
paragraph specifies will not exist. Decide the mechanism when the brief is written; do not let the
writer improvise it.

**`references/prose-quality` arrives in this batch** and batch 3's `doc-review` names it as a
backticked path with no `./` prefix — deliberately not a link, so it does not break while the pack is
absent. Batch 6 converts it to a real link. See `research/briefs/batch-03-define.md` for why that
spelling was chosen; `src/util/links.ts` is what makes the distinction real.

**`v0.1.0` is tagged at the end of this batch.** The plan's "useful first operational release" is
reached here.

## Unrouted — reaches backwards into a closed batch

**`doc-review/feasibility` / `plan-review/architect`** is an unresolved candidate pair in §12.2's
table. Both seats are `status: authored`; `plan-review/architect` was authored in batch 1, which is
closed and out of fix cycles. §12.2 says leaving a candidate unresolved is not an option and routes
backward-reaching pairs to the earlier batch's fix cycle — a cycle that no longer exists. Routed to
`authoring` as a contract-level question on 2026-09-19; it has no owner until that is answered.

The sibling pair, `doc-review/design-lens` / `code-review/frontend-races`, is entirely within batch 2
and is in that batch's cycle-2 fix.

## Standing traps — not batch-scoped

**`plan` and `arch` are two spellings of one document.** The architecture document is
`research/sources/engineering-skills-repo-plan.md`, 676 lines, registered in
`provenance/upstream.lock.yaml` as local source id `plan` and anchored by digest. The locator
grammar accepts both `plan §N` (255 rows use it) and `arch §N` (no row uses it). The file's
`-repo-plan` suffix is why two names grew for one file.

The *implementation* plan is a third document, is not in this tree, and `plan §N` does not mean it.
`policies/resolved-conflicts.yaml` uses `plan:` for the architecture document's sections, so reading
`plan` as the implementation plan misreads 255 rows.

**Nothing enforced §12.2's mandated verbatim rows** until the gate commissioned on 2026-09-19. The
narrowed row survived in 29 bodies from `ed81a69` through a writer, two reviewers and every
instrument in `src/`. If that gate is not in the tree when a later batch authors a role body, the
same failure is available again.

**`git log --author` cannot distinguish the lanes.** Every commit carries one identity. Authorship
lives in the commit message and the paths touched, both writer-controlled and neither checked; git
here records custody and nothing else. Anything routed by author silently returns the whole team.
