# What fraction of the catalog is authored, derived rather than remembered.
#
# This repository has paid three times for a figure written into prose and
# left there: two dossier line counts that said 2264 when the file was 2265,
# and a §5 passage that named both of them as examples of the defect after
# they had been repaired. A count that can be derived should never be
# transcribed, because the transcription has no way to notice it went stale.
#
#   ./research/probes/catalog-progress.sh           # working tree
#   ./research/probes/catalog-progress.sh 7a83f25   # any revision
#
# WHAT IT COMPARES AGAINST
#
# The baseline: the count for each section that catalog.yaml first declared at
# a185bd1 -- 33 skills, 8 packs, 7 protocols, 29 roles, 4 reference packs, 14
# schemas, 5 policies, 4 profiles and 4 adapters. It is duplicated below, which
# is the one transcription this script cannot avoid, and where the baseline
# commit is reachable the script checks the duplicate against it. The baseline
# is that commit, not the arch plan in research/sources/, whose own lists
# differ (it names 11 schema files and 6 adapters).
#
# A section is allowed to grow past the baseline only through
# research/probes/catalog-expansions.yaml, which records each added id with
# the reason and the commit or decision record that added it. The target a
# section is compared against is the baseline count plus the ids recorded
# there, so a recorded expansion reads clean and an unrecorded one still flags.
#
# Recording rather than moving the numbers below is the deliberate part: a
# permanent DISAGREEMENT row is a broken exit status that everyone learns to
# read past, and a target moved in place loses the reason it moved. The script
# once carried two such reasons in this comment (the case and rulings schemas);
# they now live in the expansions file beside every other one.
#
# A record cannot explain a difference it did not cause. The probe flags a
# recorded id missing from its catalog section, a recorded `baseline` or
# `catalog` figure that no longer matches, a recorded id the baseline catalog
# already had, and a cited commit that does not resolve or whose catalog.yaml
# change does not add the ids it is cited for. The history checks need the
# baseline and the cited commits; in a shallow clone that lacks them, they are
# reported as skipped rather than guessed. A clone that has the baseline but
# not every cited commit skips only what depends on the missing ones.
# CATALOG_BASELINE names another baseline commit, which the tests use on
# fixture repositories.
#
# Output: the table on stdout, one `EXPANDED` line per section with recorded
# expansions, one `SKIPPED` line per history check a shallow clone cannot run,
# and `DISAGREEMENT <code> <section>` lines on stderr with exit status 1.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT TELL YOU
#
# `status: authored` means a body exists and the entry says so. It does not
# mean the body passed review, that its evals are tagged, or that anything is
# correct. `ak validate` answers the first; `evals.uncovered-scenarios`
# answers the second and answers it over the whole corpus rather than per
# skill, which is a distinction that has already produced one checkpoint gate
# reading green on a skill that has no case at all. Progress here is progress
# through the authoring queue and nothing more.
