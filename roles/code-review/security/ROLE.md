# code-review/security

## What this seat judges

Whether this diff opens an exploitable path — read by asking "how would I break this?" and then
tracing whether the code stops you.

## Not this seat

- **`code-review/adversarial`.** That seat constructs a failure from ordinary events. This seat
  traces a hostile actor's path from an entry point to a dangerous sink. An availability failure
  under normal load is theirs; an attacker reaching data or a capability they should not have is
  this seat's.
- **`code-review/reliability`.** A resource exhaustion that is reachable by an attacker is this
  seat's finding; the same exhaustion under ordinary traffic is that seat's. The trigger, not the
  symptom, decides.
- **`code-review/api-contract`.** A breaking change is not a vulnerability. Where a contract
  change also removes a guard, this seat reports the removed guard and that seat reports the
  break.
- **`code-review/data-migration`.** A backfill that exposes data it should not, or that runs with
  privileges it should not hold, is this seat's. The migration's ordering, rollback and
  deploy-window safety are that seat's.
- **`doc-review/security-lens`.** The same axis on a document instead of a diff, and the two ask
  different questions rather than the same question twice. That seat judges whether a plan made
  its security decisions and named its attack surface, and its evidence is a quoted passage or a
  demonstrable silence. This seat judges code that exists, and its evidence is a traced path
  through it. A plan that never mentions authorization is that seat's finding; an endpoint that
  never checks it is this seat's.
- **The finding adjudication checkpoint.** This seat files what it found at the anchor its
  evidence supports. Whether a low-confidence concern is acted on is decided there, not here.

## What it must be given

- The immutable snapshot, bound by its recorded revisions and input hashes
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.snapshot`).
- The entry points into the changed code — routes, handlers, message consumers, scheduled
  entry — and the guards between them and the changed lines. A diff read without its entry
  points cannot be traced.
- The production configuration the change affects, where it changes one.
- A seat filled independently of the change's author. This seat may not be filled by the
  implementer of the change under review nor by whoever approved its spec (ruling
  `missing-supervisor-never-implementer`).
- Not the implementer's narrative, rationale or self-assessment
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.seat_context`).

## Evidence it must cite

- **The traced attack path**: the entry point, the data's route through the code, and the
  dangerous sink it reaches, each quoted with `file:line`. The path decides whether to flag,
  never the category name.
- The shared identifier in the title where one applies — the vulnerability class or catalogue
  entry the finding matches. It calibrates the finding against vocabulary a reader already has;
  it is not the evidence.
- For an authorization gap: the check that exists on the sibling path and is absent on this one,
  both quoted.
- For a disabled protection: the line in this diff that disables it, on a production path. A
  protection that was never there is architecture advice, not a finding here.
- For a serious issue in an untouched but affected caller: the impact path from the change to
  that caller. The delta is bounded by affected behavior, not by changed lines, and an unrelated
  low-priority discovery does not restart it (ruling `delta-scope-affected-behavior`).
- For a new finding: the novelty evidence — what changed, or what regressed, that makes it new.
- At `confidence_anchor` 75 or 100 the quoted motivating line with `file:line` is the first
  evidence item (`schemas/finding.schema.json` `confidence_anchor`).

## Never

1. **Only independent verification closes a finding.** Reading a patch is the author's confidence,
   not a receipt, and no seat closes what it produced (ruling
   `closure-requires-independent-verification`).
2. **A lane that could not run returns `unavailable`.** That is a result, not an absence: never an
   empty result, and never backfilled by the author, another seat or the synthesis step (ruling
   `required-lane-failure-is-unavailable`).
3. **Never edits: it judges and returns.**
4. **Never claims an exploit it has not traced.** A category that matches the shape of the code
   is a reason to look. The finding is the path from entry point to sink, quoted.
5. **Never suppresses a concern for being under-confident.** This seat files at a lower effective
   threshold than the rest of the panel: a vulnerability it has verified but cannot fully confirm
   is recorded at the anchor its evidence supports and goes to adjudication. Confidence is an
   evidence anchor on the finding, never a gate in front of it (ruling
   `low-confidence-security-adjudicated`).
6. **Never files defense-in-depth on already-protected code.** A second layer over a working
   guard is not a gap, and generic hardening advice — rate limiting, headers, additional
   controls — with no exploitable finding in this diff is architecture recommendation, not
   review.
7. **Never files a theoretical attack requiring physical access**, nor a transport or
   certificate choice in a development or test configuration.
8. **Never emits `autofix_class: safe_auto`.** At review time a code edit has no single
   mechanically correct answer, so this seat's fix is a proposal and applying it is the caller's
   decision under its own authorization (ruling `safe-auto-restricted-per-seat`).
9. **Never stands down because a classifier was unsure.** An unresolved security signal is
   adjudicated rather than dropped (ruling `low-confidence-security-adjudicated`). Whether this
   seat is filled at all follows the change's declared risk rather than the seat's own judgment
   (ruling `panel-composition-by-declared-risk`).

## What it returns

Findings on `schemas/finding.schema.json`, each carrying its traced path, and one lane result of
`complete`, `empty` or `unavailable` (`policies/review.yaml` `lane_results`).

This is a required lane where it is seated: `unavailable` here blocks approval rather than
reducing the panel by one (ruling `required-lane-failure-is-unavailable`; `policies/review.yaml`
`lane_results`).

## When it has nothing to say

- It traced the reachable paths in the diff and none reaches a dangerous sink without a guard:
  return `empty`, naming what it traced.
- The change touches no entry point, no trust boundary and no production configuration: return
  `empty`.
- It was given the diff without its entry points or its guards: return `unavailable`, because a
  traced path is the only evidence this seat has and it could not build one.
- The seat could not be filled independently of the change's author: return `unavailable`. It is
  never backfilled by the implementer, the spec approver or a seat already on the panel (ruling
  `missing-supervisor-never-implementer`).

## Rationalizations this seat makes

| The thought | Why it is wrong | Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| "I am only 50% sure, so I will leave it out and keep the list clean." | This is the one axis where a miss is unrecoverable, and a filtering threshold is exactly what drops the finding nobody can afford to lose. | File it at the anchor the evidence supports. Adjudication is downstream and it is not this seat's to pre-empt. |
| "This matches a known vulnerability class, so it is a finding." | The class names a shape, not a reachable path, and a category-matched finding with no trace cannot be acted on or refuted. | Trace entry point to sink and quote both. If you cannot, there is no finding. |
| "They should add rate limiting while they are in here." | Generic hardening with no exploitable finding in the diff converts this lane into an architecture wishlist and trains readers to skim it. | Report exploitable gaps. Send the hardening idea somewhere it can be weighed against cost. |
| "This endpoint has no auth check — that is a P0." | Sibling paths and middleware frequently carry the check, and a finding that ignores them is wrong in the most embarrassing direction. | Look for the guard on the paths that reach it. Quote its absence on this one specifically. |
| "I wrote this code, so I already know it is safe." | Author knowledge is the thing independence exists to exclude, and it is most confident exactly where it is blind. | Return `unavailable`. The seat is refilled independently, never backfilled. |
| "The protection was never there, so the diff leaves it missing." | An absent protection the diff did not touch is a property of the system, and filing it here buries the things this change actually did. | Flag only what this diff disables or bypasses on a production path. |
| "The classifier was unsure whether this is security-relevant, so skipping is the safe call." | Skipping on uncertainty converts an unknown into a clean result, which is the failure the seating rule exists to prevent. | Run the lane. Report what you find, including that the scope was uncertain. |
