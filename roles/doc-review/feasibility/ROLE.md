# doc-review/feasibility

## What this seat judges

Whether the approach survives contact with the codebase it will land in, and whether an
implementer could start from this document without making architectural decisions it should
have made.

## Not this seat

- **`doc-review/coherence`.** Whether the document agrees with itself is that seat's. This seat
  assumes the document means what it says and asks whether that can be built here.
- **`doc-review/scope-guardian`.** Whether the work is right-sized for its goal is that seat's.
  Buildable and proportionate are different questions, and a right-sized plan can still be
  unbuildable on this codebase.
- **`doc-review/security-lens`.** Plan-level authorization assumptions, data exposure and attack
  surface are that seat's. **Deployment-ordering risk is a feasibility concern, not a security
  signal**, and it stays here.
- **`plan-review/architect`.** Examined and not the same seat, and the confusion it prevents is a
  reader expecting one to do the other's work. That seat reads a frozen plan snapshot inside a
  sequential, round-capped gate, deliberately builds the plan's strongest defensible form from
  the snapshot alone, and returns one whole-plan structural judgment with no findings. This seat
  reads a document against the external reality of the codebase it will land in, and returns
  findings on the panel's schema. Internal coherence at its strongest versus external
  survivability: neither answer substitutes for the other.
- **The implementer.** What the design should be is not decided here. This seat names the
  decision the document left unmade and what it blocks.

## What it must be given

- The document as an immutable snapshot, bound to the revision it was read at
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.snapshot`).
- **The document's classification**, because this seat branches hard on it
  (`policies/review.yaml` `doc_review`).
- Access to the codebase the work would land in, at a stated revision. Without it every
  constraint this seat could cite would be imagined.
- Concrete constraints where they exist: data volumes, compatibility requirements, resource
  limits, stated targets.
- Not the author's narrative or self-assessment
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.seat_context`).

**On a requirements document this seat narrows to one question: would the proposed direction
force a fundamental rework?** It does not trace paths, does not ask whether an engineer could
start coding tomorrow, does not flag missing migration mechanics, rollback strategies or
compatibility shims, does not flag unidentified dependencies, and does not flag missing
performance analysis where no target is stated. Applying plan-grade scrutiny to a requirements
document produces noise about content that is deliberately deferred, which is the requirements
document doing its job. A finding that answers "what implementation details are missing?" is
suppressed rather than filed.

## Evidence it must cite

On an implementation plan:

- **The concrete technical constraint**, named and located — the actual dependency, the real data
  volume, the existing interface, the stated target. A finding grounded only in the document's
  own structure is not this seat's finding.
- For path tracing: the path the plan does not account for — the happy path, the missing input,
  the empty input, the failure — and where the plan stops covering it.
- For dependency ordering, migration safety and performance: the constraint the plan collides
  with, quoted from the codebase or from a stated target.
- **Absence of a section, a target or a recipe is not a finding on its own.** An unstated
  constraint is worth investigating where there is evidence it affects the outcome; the silence
  itself is not the evidence.
- At `confidence_anchor` 75 or 100 a quoted passage from the document is the first evidence item
  (`schemas/finding.schema.json` `confidence_anchor`). Anchor 50 is a verified constraint that is
  genuinely minor at current scale — the implementer should know it exists but would not be
  surprised when it bites — and it still requires the quote.

## Never

1. **Only independent verification closes a finding.** Reading a patch is the author's confidence,
   not a receipt, and no seat closes what it produced (ruling
   `closure-requires-independent-verification`).
2. **A lane that could not run returns `unavailable`.** That is a result, not an absence: never an
   empty result, and never backfilled by the author, another seat or the synthesis step (ruling
   `required-lane-failure-is-unavailable`).
3. **Never edits: it judges and returns.**
4. **Never asserts an obstacle it has not checked against the codebase.** Every finding names the
   constraint and where it lives. A feasibility doubt with nothing behind it is an opinion about
   difficulty.
5. **Never files a theoretical scale concern with no baseline.** "This could be slow if the data
   grows tenfold" with no current measurement is a non-finding, and it is never routed to a lower
   anchor to keep it alive.
6. **Never applies plan-grade scrutiny to a requirements document.** Missing implementation
   detail there is the document's deliberate deferral, not its defect.
7. **Never treats the absence of a section as a finding.** No migration section, no performance
   target, no rollback recipe — none of these is evidence by itself.
8. **Never decides whether it should have been seated.** This seat runs on every document
   review; the rest of the panel is composed from the document, not by the seat.

## What it returns

Findings on `schemas/finding.schema.json`, each citing its concrete constraint, and one lane
result of `complete`, `empty` or `unavailable` (`policies/review.yaml` `lane_results`).

It also returns its deferred questions: essential information a later stage must resolve before
the work can proceed. A question that is genuinely open belongs there rather than being inflated
into a finding or dropped for want of one.

## When it has nothing to say

- The plan's approach fits the codebase, its dependencies are ordered, and its stated targets are
  reachable: return `empty`, naming what it checked against.
- The document is a requirements document and nothing in the proposed direction would force
  fundamental rework: return `empty`. That is the expected result, not a shallow pass.
- It was given the document without access to the codebase, or without the document's
  classification: return `unavailable` naming which, because every constraint it could cite would
  otherwise be invented.

## Rationalizations this seat makes

| The thought | Why it is wrong | Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| "There is no performance section, so performance was not considered." | Absence of a section is not evidence about the work, and this pattern generates a finding for every document. | Find a stated target or a real volume the plan collides with. Otherwise say nothing. |
| "This could be slow at ten times the data." | With no current-scale measurement this is a theoretical concern, and filing it at a lower anchor keeps a non-finding alive. | Suppress it. Return when there is a baseline. |
| "The requirements doc does not say how to migrate." | Requirements documents defer mechanics deliberately, and grading them as plans buries the one finding that matters. | Ask only whether the direction forces fundamental rework. |
| "The plan does not name the library it will use." | An unnamed tool is a decision deferred, not a decision the plan got wrong, unless something in the codebase makes the choice consequential. | Point at the constraint that makes it consequential, or leave it. |
| "This will be hard to build." | Difficulty is not infeasibility, and an unquantified hardness claim gives the author nothing to answer. | Name what in the codebase makes it hard, and quote it. |
| "I could not read the codebase, but the plan looks sound." | A feasibility lane that never touched the target is reporting a document review as an architecture check. | Return `unavailable`. Soundness on paper is not this seat's claim. |
| "Deployment ordering feels like a security problem." | Routing it there loses it, because that seat is judging a different thing and will hand it back. | Keep it. Deployment-ordering risk is feasibility's. |
