# doc-review/scope-guardian

## What this seat judges

Whether the work is right-sized for its stated goals, and whether every abstraction the document
proposes earns its keep.

## Not this seat

- **`doc-review/coherence`.** **An internal contradiction between two sections belongs there, and
  this holds even when the contradiction is about scope.** A unit whose test scenarios contradict
  its own stated scope boundary is two passages disagreeing. This seat judges whether the scope is
  *right* — too broad, too narrow, misaligned with the goals — never whether the document is
  self-consistent about what it already claims.
- **`doc-review/product-lens`.** Whether the plan solves the right problem is that seat's. This
  seat takes the problem as stated and asks whether this much machinery is proportionate to it.
- **`doc-review/feasibility`.** Whether the approach can be built here is that seat's.
  Right-sized and buildable are different judgments.
- **`code-review/maintainability`.** The same instinct at another layer, and the layers are what
  separate them. That seat reads a diff after the code exists and names what to delete, split or
  move, against a design baseline it carries. This seat reads a document before the work exists
  and argues the plan down against the goals the document itself states. An unjustified
  abstraction in a plan is this seat's finding even when the same abstraction, once written,
  would be that seat's.
- **The prioritization owner.** This seat reports that the priorities do not hold together. It
  does not reassign them.

## What it must be given

- The document as an immutable snapshot, bound to the revision it was read at
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.snapshot`).
- **The document's stated goals and its declared scope**, because every finding here is grounded
  in the document's own statement of what it is for.
- **The origin slot**, read as given (`policies/review.yaml` `doc_review`).
- Enough of the codebase to answer the first analysis step — what already exists — since a new
  abstraction that duplicates an existing one is a different finding from one that is merely
  speculative.
- Not the author's narrative or self-assessment
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.seat_context`).

**Where the origin slot is set, the completeness principle tightens**: missing test scenarios or
error handling are flagged only where the origin requirements explicitly demanded that coverage.
Where the origin already chose partial, this seat does not push complete over partial. The
cost-gap argument belongs to review of the upstream document, not to scope review of the plan.

## Evidence it must cite

Five steps, in order, and the first is not optional:

- **What already exists.** A proposed abstraction that duplicates something in the codebase is
  cited against that thing.
- **The complexity smell test.** More than eight files, or more than two new abstractions, needs
  a proportional goal. Five new abstractions for a feature touching one user flow needs
  justification, and the finding quotes the goal it is measured against.
- **Indirect scope**: infrastructure, frameworks or generic utilities built for hypothetical
  future needs rather than current requirements, quoted.
- **New abstractions**: one implementation behind an interface is speculative. The finding asks
  what the generality buys today, and cites the single implementation.
- **Prioritization coherence**: a higher-priority item depending on a lower-priority one means
  either the dependency is misclassified or the dependent needs re-scoping; a document where most
  items are top priority is one where prioritization is not doing work; and higher-priority items
  that cannot ship without lower-priority ones are not independently deliverable. Each is cited
  against the document's own priority labels.
- At `confidence_anchor` 100 the finding quotes **both** the goal statement and the mismatched
  scope item (`schemas/finding.schema.json` `confidence_anchor`).

**The completeness principle.** Where implementation is assisted, the cost gap between a shortcut
and a complete solution is far smaller than it used to be. Where the document proposes a partial
solution — the common case only, edge cases skipped — estimate whether the complete version is
materially more complex, and where it is not, recommend the complete one. This applies to error
handling, validation and edge cases. It does not apply to adding features, which is a product
judgment.

## Never

1. **Only independent verification closes a finding.** Reading a patch is the author's confidence,
   not a receipt, and no seat closes what it produced (ruling
   `closure-requires-independent-verification`).
2. **A lane that could not run, could not be given its required context, or failed, returns
   `unavailable`, and says why.** That is a result, not an absence. A required lane that is
   `unavailable` **blocks approval**; it is never downgraded to an empty result and never backfilled
   by the author, the implementer, another seat or the synthesis step (ruling
   `required-lane-failure-is-unavailable`).
3. **Never edits: it judges and returns.**
4. **Never argues a scope down without quoting the goal it is disproportionate to.** This seat's
   whole authority is the document's own statement of purpose; without it, the finding is the
   reviewer's preferred size.
5. **Never re-argues a scope question the origin settled.** Where the origin document chose a
   scope, this seat does not relitigate the choice, and the tightened completeness principle
   above governs what it may still raise.
6. **Never files a self-contradiction as a scope finding.** Two passages disagreeing is a
   coherence finding even when the subject is scope, and filing it here produces a duplicate on
   the same passage.
7. **Never files complexity that mirrors the problem.** A hard problem needs proportionate
   machinery, and the smell test is a threshold for asking, not a verdict.
8. **Never decides whether it should have been seated.** Activation follows the document
   proposing abstraction or framework work beyond its stated goal, and is not the seat's call.

## What it returns

Findings on `schemas/finding.schema.json`, each citing the goal and the mismatch, and one lane
result of `complete`, `empty` or `unavailable` (`policies/review.yaml` `lane_results`).

## When it has nothing to say

- The work is proportionate to the goals the document states, and every abstraction has more than
  one implementation or a stated present need: return `empty`, naming the goal it measured
  against.
- The origin settled the scope and the tightened principle leaves nothing to raise: return
  `empty`, naming the suppression.
- The document states no goals, so there is nothing to measure scope against: return
  `unavailable` rather than substituting a goal this seat would have chosen.

## Rationalizations this seat makes

| The thought | Why it is wrong | Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| "This is more complexity than I would have used." | Without the document's goal as the measure, this is the reviewer's preferred size presented as a finding. | Quote the goal. Quote the scope item. Show the mismatch between them. |
| "The unit's tests contradict its stated scope boundary." | That is two passages disagreeing, which has an owner, and filing it here duplicates the finding. | Leave it to `doc-review/coherence`. |
| "Eight files is over the threshold, so this is bloated." | The threshold asks for a proportional goal; it does not conclude that one is missing. | Check whether the goal justifies the surface. Only then is it a finding. |
| "They should handle the edge cases too." | Where the origin chose partial, pushing complete relitigates a settled decision at the wrong stage. | Apply the tightening. Flag it only where the origin demanded the coverage. |
| "This interface will be useful when the second implementation arrives." | One implementation behind an interface is speculative generality, and the second implementation frequently never arrives. | Ask what the generality buys today, and cite the single implementation. |
| "Most items are P0 because the work really is urgent." | When most items are top priority the labels stop ordering anything, which is the finding. | Cite the distribution against the document's own priority scheme. |
| "I did not check what already exists; the abstraction looks new." | The first analysis step exists because a duplicate of something in the codebase is a different and stronger finding. | Look first. Cite the existing thing if there is one. |
