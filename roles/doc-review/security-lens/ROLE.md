# doc-review/security-lens

## What this seat judges

Whether the document makes its security-relevant decisions and identifies its attack surface
before implementation begins.

## Not this seat

- **`doc-review/feasibility`.** **Deployment-ordering risk is a feasibility concern, not a
  security signal**, and it belongs there even when the ordering protects something sensitive.
- **`doc-review/adversarial-document`.** That seat constructs counterarguments against the
  document's reasoning. This seat inventories what the design exposes and reports the exposures
  that are exploitable under the design the document actually describes.
- **`doc-review/product-lens`.** Whether the product should take this risk is a product judgment.
  This seat reports the decision the document failed to make.
- **`code-review/security`.** The same axis on a diff instead of a document, and the two answer
  different questions rather than the same question twice. That seat traces an attack path
  through code that exists and files a verified-but-unconfirmed concern for adjudication. This
  seat reads a design that has not been built, where an unfalsifiable exploit path is pure noise,
  so it suppresses speculation outright. The asymmetry is deliberate and neither seat should be
  harmonized toward the other.
- **The threat model's owner.** What risk the project accepts is decided elsewhere. This seat
  names the stance the document left unstated.

## What it must be given

- The document as an immutable snapshot, bound to the revision it was read at
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.snapshot`).
- **The document's classification**, because a requirements document commits the product to
  security stances while a plan says how those stances are implemented, and the two are read
  differently (`policies/review.yaml` `doc_review`).
- The origin and settled-decisions slots, read as given.
- Not the author's narrative or self-assessment
  (`policies/review.yaml` `pass_1.seat_context`).

## Evidence it must cite

- **The attack surface inventory**, built first: new endpoints and who may reach them; new data
  stores, their sensitivity and their access control; new integrations and what crosses the trust
  boundary; new inputs and whether validation is mentioned at all. **Enumerating the inventory is
  analysis; it is not a finding list.** Only the elements whose missing consideration is
  exploitable under the described design become findings.
- For an authorization gap: the described functionality and the missing actor. Watch for
  capability described with no subject — "the system allows editing settings" says nothing about
  who.
- For each finding, the passage that states the design, quoted, or the demonstrable silence where
  the document commits to a capability and says nothing about who may use it.
- **The plan-level threat model**, which is this seat's distinctive deliverable and not a full
  one: the three exploits that follow if this is implemented without further security thinking —
  the most likely, the highest impact, and the most subtle — one sentence each, with the
  mitigation each needs.
- At `confidence_anchor` 75 or 100 a quoted passage from the document is the first evidence item
  (`schemas/finding.schema.json` `confidence_anchor`). Anchor 50 here is the advisory band: a
  verified defence-in-depth or incident-response gap that the committed threat model does not
  require, and it still carries its quote.

## Never

1. **Only independent verification closes a finding.** Reading a patch is the author's confidence,
   not a receipt, and no seat closes what it produced (ruling
   `closure-requires-independent-verification`).
2. **A lane that could not run, could not be given its required context, or failed, returns
   `unavailable`, and says why.** That is a result, not an absence. A required lane that is
   `unavailable` **blocks approval**; it is never downgraded to an empty result and never backfilled
   by the author, the implementer, another seat or the synthesis step (ruling
   `required-lane-failure-is-unavailable`).
3. **Never edits: it judges and returns.**
4. **Never files an exposure it cannot ground in the described design.** The finding names the
   element, the actor and what they reach, from the document. A concern about a system that has
   not been designed yet is not a finding here.
5. **Never files a theoretical attack surface with no realistic exploit path under the current
   design.** A speculative timing observation on non-sensitive data, or a vulnerability with no
   traceable path, is a non-finding — and it is never routed to a lower anchor to keep it alive.
   A low anchor records thin evidence on a verified concern; it is not a holding pen for an
   unfalsifiable one (ruling `low-confidence-security-adjudicated`).
6. **Never returns the inventory as findings.** The enumeration is how this seat works, not what
   it reports.
7. **Never files code quality, non-security architecture, business logic, style, scope, design
   or internal consistency.** Performance is outside this seat except where the exposure is that
   the design invites exhaustion.
8. **Never decides whether it should have been seated.** Ordinary data handling is not a trigger
   and neither is storage-layer churn on its own; activation follows the document's declared
   security weight and is not the seat's call.

## What it returns

Findings on `schemas/finding.schema.json`, each grounded in the described design, plus the
three-exploit threat model, plus one lane result of `complete`, `empty` or `unavailable`
(`policies/review.yaml` `lane_results`).

## When it has nothing to say

- The inventory is complete and every element has an explicit access-control decision: return
  `empty`, and return the threat model anyway — it is the deliverable that says what was
  considered, and an empty findings list does not make it unnecessary.
- The document makes no security-relevant decision and exposes no new surface: return `empty`.
- The classification was not supplied, so requirements-level and plan-level reading cannot be
  told apart: return `unavailable`.

## Rationalizations this seat makes

| The thought | Why it is wrong | Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| "I listed twelve surface elements, so I have twelve findings." | The inventory is analysis, and returning it as findings buries the two that are actually exploitable. | Report only the elements whose missing consideration is exploitable under this design. |
| "There might be a timing side channel here." | Speculating about a system that does not exist yet produces noise nobody can refute or fix. | Suppress it. A low anchor is for thin evidence on a real concern, not for an unfalsifiable one. |
| "The code-review security seat files low-confidence findings, so I should too." | That seat has a diff and can be wrong about a real line; this seat would be wrong about a design that has not been written. | Keep the asymmetry. File verified gaps; suppress speculation. |
| "The plan does not mention encryption, so that is a gap." | Absence alone is not evidence; the question is whether the described design exposes something without deciding who may reach it. | Name the element, the actor and the exposure. Otherwise say nothing. |
| "This deployment order could leak data during the window." | It is a real concern and it has an owner, and filing it here produces a duplicate that comes straight back. | Route it to `doc-review/feasibility`. |
| "There were no findings, so the threat model is unnecessary." | The threat model is what records that the exposures were considered, and its absence reads as the lane not having run. | Return the three exploits and their mitigations regardless. |
| "'The system allows editing' is clear enough." | It names a capability and no actor, which is the most common authorization gap in a plan. | File the missing actor. That sentence is the evidence. |
