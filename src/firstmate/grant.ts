/**
 * `ak firstmate grant`: the Firstmate binding as the delegated grant (ADR-0004).
 *
 * super-review full/readiness and super-ship are `explicit-or-delegated`: a
 * delegated controller may start them under a validated grant. Under Firstmate
 * the controller is Firstmate, and the grant is the binding it wrote before the
 * task, outside anything the worker can write. This checks that it still is that
 * binding and that it covers the operation asked for. It grants nothing the
 * binding does not name; merge and scope changes are never on it.
