/**
 * AUTHORING.md §10's contract-defects rules, as checks rather than as prose.
 *
 * §10 specifies three mechanical behaviours and, at the time this was written,
 * stated in three separate paragraphs that `ak validate` performed none of
 * them. Two are file-state rules over `CONTRACT-DEFECTS.md` and are performed
 * here. The third -- the recorded-revision gate -- is not: it reads a review
 * record's covered files and a notice recorded against a newer revision, and
 * `schemas/review.schema.json` declares neither, so there is nothing in this
 * tree for it to read. That is a missing field, not a missing check, and it is
 * reported rather than approximated.
 *
 * The retirement rule. An entry is retired by deleting it, so the file has one
 * entry list and no second one under any name. §10: "a resolved entry reads
 * exactly like an open one to anything scanning this file", which is why the
 * detector here is on the file's shape and not on an entry's wording.
 *
 * The entry-quotation rule. An open entry's quoted instruction must still
 * resolve in the section it cites, whitespace collapsed, scoped to that section
 * rather than to the file, failing closed when the citation cannot be resolved,
 * and resolving on the section number so a gloss cannot manufacture the
 * unresolvable case. Each of those four clauses is a case §10 argues for
 * explicitly, and three of them are ways a generous implementation passes an
 * entry it should fail.
 *
 * `research/probes/defect-entries.py` is the same comparison as a probe, and
 * keeps the differential backtest over `f04a4d0` that needs git history. This
 * module is an independent implementation of the rule, not a port of that file:
 * agreement between two of them is worth something, and a translation would
 * not be.
