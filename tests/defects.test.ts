/**
 * AUTHORING.md §10's two file-state rules, as `ak validate` now performs them.
 *
 * The cases below are seeded from `research/probes/defect-entries.py` at
 * `f5cec72` (sha256 95ca402e...), which is the only enforcement either rule has
 * had. They are reproduced rather than imported: a gate whose cases came from
 * the probe's own source could not disagree with it, and the point of moving
 * this into `src/` is that a second implementation either agrees or says why.
 *
 * The prose-only citation leads, because it is the case a checker gets wrong by
 * being generous. §10: "An entry that names no section the check can resolve
 * fails this rule rather than falling outside it: a checker that widens to the
 * whole file when it cannot find the scope restores the loose behaviour exactly
 * where the entry gave it least to work with."
