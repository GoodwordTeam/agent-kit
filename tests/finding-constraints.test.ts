/**
 * The conditional branches in finding.schema.json, exercised against the
 * shipped schema rather than a synthetic stand-in.
 *
 * tests/schemas.test.ts covers the compile-and-report machinery using small
 * hand-written schemas, which is the right shape for testing the machinery and
 * the wrong shape for testing a constraint: a copy of the constraint inside a
 * test proves the copy works. These cases read schemas/ off disk at run time,
 * so a branch that is edited or deleted is a branch these tests stop agreeing
 * with. Nothing here is duplicated into tests/fixtures/, for the same reason.
 *
 * The rejections assert on the field the branch guards rather than on ajv's
 * wording, which differs per keyword: a missing excerpt reports `required`, a
 * counter-evidence-only array reports `contains`. What makes a rejection
 * meaningful is the accepting case beside it -- the same evidence passes at a
 * lower anchor, so a rejection cannot be the fixture being malformed.
 *
 * The blocks follow the order of the schema's root `allOf`, so a reader can
 * cross-reference a branch by position. Two clauses are deliberately not
 * claimed to be isolated, and say so where they sit: the `smell` branch's ban
 * on a fixer dispatch and the fixer branch's `spec_quality` restriction are
 * the same rule written twice, since `smell` is exactly the value the fixer
 * branch excludes. Either one alone still rejects the document, so no fixture
 * can attribute the rejection to one of them. Those cases pin the behaviour
 * the rulings require, not the clause that happens to deliver it.
 *
 * Every case here was negative-tested by deleting its branch from the schema
 * and confirming the case fails -- a constraint test that still passes with
 * the constraint deleted is measuring nothing, and reading it cannot tell you
 * which kind you have.
