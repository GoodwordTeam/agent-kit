/**
 * The typechecker and the packager, wired into the thing that already runs.
 *
 * `bun test` transpiles and does not typecheck, so until this file existed a
 * type error reached a commit and was found by whoever next ran `tsc` by hand.
 * The gate was deferred once, correctly, because `tsc` was exiting 1 over an
 * in-flight file and a gate that starts red is a gate people learn to skip. It
 * exits 0 over the whole tree now, so the reason has expired.
 *
 * It lives in a test rather than in `package.json`'s `test` script so that it
 * runs however the suite is invoked, and only when the whole suite is invoked --
 * a single-file `bun test tests/foo.test.ts` does not pay for it.
 *
 * Three assertions and not one. "`tsc` exits 0" is true of a tree that
 * typechecks and equally true of a `tsc` that checked nothing, so the exit code
 * is paired with a population check (every file in `src/` and `tests/` is in the
 * checked set) and a positive control (the binary still reports a planted
 * error). Each answers a different way the first one can be a lie.

/**
 * `ak build --check` is deliberately NOT gated here, and the reason is a finding.
 *
 * It was gated, briefly, and it passed -- because this working tree happened to
 * carry a `dist/` from an earlier build. In a clean `git archive` extract the
 * same command emits 22 `packaging.dist-missing` errors, because `dist/` is
 * generated and `.gitignore`d and therefore absent from every fresh checkout.
 *
 * So it is not a gate. It is a post-build verification whose result is decided
 * by uncommitted local state: green for a developer who has built, red for one
 * who has not, and neither answer is about the tree. AGENTS.md lists it in the
 * pre-commit block beside `bun test` without saying that `ak build` has to
 * precede it, which is the same trap one level up.
 *
 * Gating it properly means building to a scratch directory and checking there,
 * and `ak build` has no output-directory flag today. That is a packaging change
 * and it is reported rather than bodged in here -- a test that ran `ak build`
 * into the repository would write `dist/` during the suite and race the other
 * lanes working in this tree.
